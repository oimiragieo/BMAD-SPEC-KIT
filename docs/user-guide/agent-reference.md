## Agent Interaction Patterns

### Sequential Workflows
Most projects follow logical agent sequences:
```
1. Analyst ‚Üí 2. PM ‚Üí 3. Architect ‚Üí 4. UX Expert ‚Üí 5. Developer ‚Üí 6. QA
```

### Parallel Execution
For medium to complex projects:
```
Architect + UX Expert (parallel) ‚Üí Developer ‚Üí QA
```

### Orchestrated Workflows
For complex enterprise projects:
```
Orchestrator ‚Üí (All agents in optimized sequence) ‚Üí Master (final integration)
```

## Agent Activation Examples

### Direct Agent Activation
```
"Activate the Architect agent to design a microservices system"
"I need the UX Expert to create accessible user interfaces"
"Have the QA agent review this implementation strategy"
```

### Automatic Agent Selection
```
"Create a task management web application"
‚Üí System selects appropriate agents based on complexity

"Build a secure fintech API"
‚Üí Analyst, Architect, Developer, QA automatically activated
```

### Multi-Agent Workflows
```
"Design and implement a comprehensive CRM system"
‚Üí Full orchestration with all 10 agents coordinated
```

## Quality Standards

All agents follow enterprise rules:

### Writing Excellence
- Professional, human-like communication
- No corporate jargon or AI patterns
- Clear, actionable documentation

### Code Quality
- 80%+ test coverage requirement
- Security-first development practices
- Performance optimization standards

### Security Standards
- Zero-trust architecture principles
- Comprehensive validation requirements
- Audit trail maintenance

### Design Standards
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Performance-optimized interfaces

## Customization Options

### Adding Custom Agents
Create new agents in `.claude/agents/`:
```
custom-agent/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prompt.md              # Agent definition and capabilities
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ expertise.md           # Domain-specific knowledge
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ guidelines.md          # Custom operation guidelines
```

### Modifying Existing Agents
Edit agent prompts to:
- Add domain-specific expertise
- Modify thinking trigger usage
- Customize output formats
- Integrate organization standards

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Activating
1. Verify `.claude/agents/` directory structure
2. Check agent `prompt.md` files exist
3. Confirm CLAUDE.md references agents correctly

### Poor Agent Performance
1. Review Claude thinking trigger usage
2. Verify enterprise rules integration
3. Check context preservation between agents

### Quality Issues
1. Validate quality gates are active
2. Review cross-agent validation settings
2. Confirm enterprise rules are applied
