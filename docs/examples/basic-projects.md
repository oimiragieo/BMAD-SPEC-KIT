## Step-by-Step Walkthrough: Blog Platform

Let's walk through creating a personal blog platform to see how the system works.

### Step 1: Project Initialization

```bash
# Set up your project
mkdir my-blog-platform
cd my-blog-platform
cp -r /path/to/BMAD-SPEC-KIT/bmad-spec-orchestrator-kit/.claude .
```

### Step 2: Agent Activation

In Claude Code:
```
I want to create a personal blog platform where I can write and publish markdown articles with basic categorization.
```

### Step 3: System Response

```
üéØ BMAD-Spec Orchestrator Activated
üìä Complexity Assessment: Level 2/10 - Simple Application  
üîÑ Recommended Workflow: greenfield-ui

Activating streamlined workflow for simple application...

üîç Analyst Agent (Optional): Quick market analysis
üìã PM Agent: Feature planning and user stories
üíª Developer Agent: Direct implementation
```

### Step 4: PM Agent Planning

The PM Agent uses `think` for standard planning:

```markdown
## Product Requirements Document: Personal Blog Platform

### Core Features
1. **Article Management**
   - Write articles in Markdown
   - Save drafts and publish
   - Edit existing articles

2. **Categorization System**  
   - Assign categories to articles
   - Filter articles by category
   - Category management interface

3. **Public Display**
   - Clean, readable article display
   - Category navigation
   - Mobile-responsive design

### User Stories
- As a writer, I can create new blog posts in Markdown
- As a writer, I can organize posts with categories
- As a reader, I can browse posts by category
```

### Step 5: Developer Implementation

The Developer Agent follows enterprise rules:

```typescript
// Generated with 80% test coverage requirement
// WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
// Performance optimized

// Article management with comprehensive validation
export interface Article {
  id: string
  title: string
  content: string
  category: string
  published: boolean
  createdAt: Date
  updatedAt: Date
}

// Secure, validated API endpoints
export class ArticleService {
  // Implementation with error handling
  // Input validation and sanitization
  // Performance optimizations
}
```

### Step 6: Quality Assurance

Automatic quality gates ensure:
- ‚úÖ Code quality standards met
- ‚úÖ Accessibility requirements satisfied
- ‚úÖ Security best practices applied
- ‚úÖ Test coverage above 80%
- ‚úÖ Performance optimized

## Common Patterns You'll See

### Agent Selection Logic

**Simple requests** ‚Üí Direct to Developer
```
"Create a calculator app"
‚Üí Developer Agent with basic implementation
```

**Business requests** ‚Üí PM + Developer
```  
"Build a customer feedback system"
‚Üí PM Agent (planning) ‚Üí Developer Agent (implementation)
```

**Complex systems** ‚Üí Full orchestration
```
"Design a multi-tenant SaaS platform"
‚Üí All 10 agents with quality gates
```

### Thinking Optimization Patterns

**Simple logic** ‚Üí `think`
```
Validation, basic implementation, documentation
```

**Important decisions** ‚Üí `think hard`  
```
Technology selection, user experience design
```

**Complex analysis** ‚Üí `think harder`
```
Architecture trade-offs, risk assessment
```

**Critical decisions** ‚Üí `ultrathink`
```
Security architecture, system design
```

### Quality Gate Patterns

**Level 1-2 Projects:**

- Accessibility validation
- Simple security review

**Level 3-4 Projects:**
- Cross-agent validation
- Performance optimization
- Comprehensive testing

**Level 5+ Projects:**

- Security audits
- Enterprise compliance

## Tips for Success

### Request Formulation

**Be specific about purpose:**
‚úÖ "Create a blog platform for personal writing"
‚ùå "Make a website"

**Include key requirements:**
‚úÖ "Inventory system with low stock alerts"
‚ùå "Something for tracking stuff"

**Mention complexity when known:**
‚úÖ "Simple task tracker for personal use"
‚úÖ "Enterprise CRM system with advanced analytics"

### Working with Agents

**Let agents complete their work:**
- Don't interrupt mid-process
- Allow full context building
- Trust the quality gates

**Provide feedback when needed:**
- "The UX design should focus more on mobile"
- "Add two-factor authentication for security"
- "Include API documentation"

**Request specific thinking levels:**
- "Use ultrathink for the security architecture"
- "Think harder about the database design trade-offs"

### Customizing Output

**Modify enterprise rules** in `.claude/rules/`:
- Adjust coding standards
- Update design requirements  
- Modify security policies

**Add domain knowledge** in `.claude/data/`:
- Industry-specific information
- Technical preferences
- Custom methodologies
