## How it works

The BMAD-Spec Orchestrator uses 10 specialized AI agents working through Claude Code to transform natural language requests into complete software solutions.

### Core agents (6)
- **üîç Analyst** - Requirements and market research
- **üìã PM** - Product management and specifications  
- **üèóÔ∏è Architect** - System design with security-first approach
- **üé® UX Expert** - User experience and interface design
- **üíª Developer** - Full-stack development and testing
- **üß™ QA** - Comprehensive quality assurance

### Orchestration agents (4)
- **üßô BMAD Master** - Universal task executor
- **üé≠ BMAD Orchestrator** - Workflow coordination
- **üìù Product Owner** - Backlog and story management
- **üèÉ Scrum Master** - Process facilitation

### Intelligence features
- **Claude thinking optimization** - Uses `ultrathink`, `think harder`, `think hard` for optimal decision quality
- **Complexity scoring** - Automatically selects appropriate workflows (1-10 scale)
- **Context preservation** - Maintains perfect context across all agent interactions
- **Quality gates** - Comprehensive validation at every step

## Key concepts

### Agent activation
Agents activate automatically when you describe what you want to build:
```
"I need to create a web application for project management"
```

Claude recognizes this as a trigger and activates the orchestration system.

### Thinking optimization
Each agent uses Claude-specific thinking triggers for optimal performance:
- **`ultrathink`** - Critical decisions (architecture, security)
- **`think harder`** - Complex analysis (risk assessment, prioritization)  
- **think hard`** - Important tasks (market research, UX design)
- **`think`** - Standard reasoning and validation

### Quality standards
All agents follow enterprise rules from `.claude/rules/`:
- Professional writing without corporate jargon
- Security-first development practices
- 80%+ test coverage requirements
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- Performance optimization throughout

## Enterprise features

### Security-first approach
- **Never bypasses permissions** - No dangerous shortcuts
- **Comprehensive validation** - Every output verified
- **Audit trails** - Complete decision logging
- **Zero-trust architecture** - Security built into every component

### Performance optimization
- **Parallel execution** - UX Expert and Architect run simultaneously
- **Intelligent caching** - Reduces redundant processing  
- **Context optimization** - Structured data passing between agents
- **Resource management** - Efficient computational allocation

### Quality assurance
- **Cross-agent validation** - Agents verify each other's work
- **Automated quality gates** - Every output meets thresholds
- **Error recovery** - Automatic retry with improved context
- **Continuous improvement** - System learns from patterns
