# Advanced Elicitation Methods for Enterprise Development

## Core Reflective Methods

### Expand or Contract for Audience
**Purpose**: Tailor content complexity for specific stakeholders
- Ask whether to 'expand' (add detail, elaborate) or 'contract' (simplify, clarify)
- Identify specific target audience: executives, developers, users, compliance
- Adjust technical depth and terminology accordingly
- Ensure appropriate level of detail for decision-making needs

### Explain Reasoning (Chain of Thought)
**Purpose**: Make decision processes transparent and reviewable
- Walk through step-by-step thinking process from agent's perspective
- Reveal underlying assumptions and decision points
- Show how conclusions were reached using domain expertise
- Enable others to follow and validate the reasoning

### Critique and Refine
**Purpose**: Improve quality through systematic review
- Review output for flaws, inconsistencies, or improvement areas
- Identify specific weaknesses from role's expertise perspective
- Suggest refined version incorporating domain knowledge
- Apply quality standards and best practices

## Structural Analysis Methods

### Analyze Logical Flow and Dependencies
**Purpose**: Ensure coherent and implementable solutions
- Examine content structure for logical progression
- Check internal consistency and coherence across sections
- Identify and validate dependencies between components
- Confirm effective ordering and sequencing of steps

### Assess Alignment with Overall Goals
**Purpose**: Maintain strategic focus and business alignment
- Evaluate how content contributes to stated objectives
- Identify any misalignments or gaps in goal achievement
- Interpret alignment from specific role's perspective
- Suggest adjustments to better serve business outcomes

## Risk and Challenge Methods

### Identify Potential Risks and Unforeseen Issues
**Purpose**: Proactive risk management and mitigation planning
- Brainstorm potential risks from role's specific expertise
- Identify overlooked edge cases or failure scenarios
- Anticipate unintended consequences of proposed solutions
- Highlight implementation challenges and complexity issues

### Challenge from Critical Perspective
**Purpose**: Stress-test solutions through adversarial thinking
- Adopt critical stance on current content and proposals
- Play devil's advocate from specified stakeholder viewpoint
- Argue against proposal highlighting significant weaknesses
- Apply YAGNI principles for scope trimming when appropriate

## Creative Exploration Methods

### Tree of Thoughts Deep Dive
**Purpose**: Systematic exploration of solution alternatives
- Break problem into discrete "thoughts" or intermediate steps
- Explore multiple reasoning paths simultaneously
- Use self-evaluation to classify each path: "confident", "likely", "uncertain"
- Apply search algorithms (breadth-first/depth-first) for optimal solutions

### Hindsight Analysis: "If Only..." Reflection
**Purpose**: Learn from potential future scenarios
- Imagine retrospective scenario based on current content
- Identify the critical "if only we had known/done X..." insight
- Describe imagined consequences and their impact
- Extract actionable learnings for current context and planning

## Multi-Perspective Collaboration Methods

### Agile Team Perspective Shift
**Purpose**: Comprehensive evaluation from all team viewpoints
- **Product Owner**: Focus on user value and business impact assessment
- **Scrum Master**: Examine process flow and team dynamics concerns
- **Developer**: Assess technical implementation complexity and feasibility
- **QA**: Identify testing scenarios and quality assurance concerns
- **UX Designer**: Evaluate user experience and accessibility implications

### Stakeholder Round Table
**Purpose**: Balanced consideration of all stakeholder interests
- Convene virtual meeting with multiple persona perspectives
- Each persona contributes unique viewpoint on content impact
- Identify conflicts and synergies between different viewpoints
- Synthesize insights into actionable recommendations and compromises

### Meta-Analysis of Approach
**Purpose**: Optimize the problem-solving methodology itself
- Step back to analyze structure and logic of current approach
- Question the format and methodology being used for the task
- Suggest alternative frameworks or mental models that might work better
- Optimize the elicitation and analysis process itself

## Advanced Enterprise Techniques

### Self-Consistency Validation
**Purpose**: Increase reliability through multiple validation paths
- Generate multiple reasoning paths for the same problem
- Compare consistency across different analytical approaches
- Identify most reliable and robust solution among alternatives
- Highlight areas where approaches diverge and investigate why

### Reasoning Without External Dependencies
**Purpose**: Efficient problem-solving using available knowledge
- Separate pure reasoning from tool-based or external research actions
- Create reasoning plan without external dependencies or data needs
- Identify what can be solved through existing knowledge and logic
- Optimize for efficiency and reduced complexity

### Persona-Pattern Hybrid Analysis
**Purpose**: Deep domain-specific analysis with structured methodology
- **Architect + Risk Analysis**: Deep technical risk assessment with mitigation
- **UX Expert + User Journey**: End-to-end experience critique and optimization
- **PM + Stakeholder Analysis**: Multi-perspective impact review and prioritization
- **QA + Test Strategy**: Comprehensive quality assurance planning and validation

### Emergent Collaboration Discovery
**Purpose**: Capture unexpected insights from multi-agent thinking
- Allow multiple perspectives to naturally emerge without forcing
- Identify unexpected insights from persona interactions and conflicts
- Explore novel combinations of viewpoints for innovative solutions
- Capture serendipitous discoveries from collaborative reasoning

## Game-Based Elicitation Methods

### Red Team vs Blue Team
**Purpose**: Adversarial testing of solutions and strategies
- **Red Team**: Attack the proposal, find vulnerabilities and weaknesses
- **Blue Team**: Defend and strengthen the approach with improvements
- Competitive analysis reveals blind spots and assumptions
- Results in more robust, battle-tested solutions

### Innovation Tournament
**Purpose**: Systematic evaluation of alternative approaches
- Pit multiple alternative approaches against each other
- Score each approach across different evaluation criteria
- Crowd-source evaluation from different persona perspectives
- Identify winning combination of features and strategies

### Constraint Challenge
**Purpose**: Creative problem-solving within limitations
- Present content as constraints to work within effectively
- Find creative solutions within tight budget/time/resource limitations
- Identify minimum viable approach that still meets core requirements
- Discover innovative workarounds and optimization opportunities

## Quality Control Methods

### Cross-Agent Validation
**Purpose**: Ensure consistency across different domain perspectives
- Have multiple agents review from their expertise perspectives
- Identify inconsistencies between different domain requirements
- Resolve conflicts through structured negotiation and compromise
- Ensure final solution satisfies all critical domain constraints

### Iterative Refinement Protocol
**Purpose**: Systematic improvement through structured feedback cycles
- Present initial solution for structured feedback
- Apply feedback systematically with clear change tracking
- Re-evaluate improved solution against original criteria
- Continue refinement cycles until quality thresholds are met

## Implementation Guidelines for Agents

**Analyst Agent**: Use perspective shifts, stakeholder analysis, risk identification
**PM Agent**: Use alignment assessment, priority challenging, stakeholder round tables
**Architect Agent**: Use technical risk analysis, constraint challenges, alternative exploration
