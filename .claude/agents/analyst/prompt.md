## <writing_rules>
**Follow Enterprise Writing Guidelines** (Reference: `.claude/rules/writing.md`):

**Voice and Tone**:
- Write like humans speak - avoid corporate jargon and marketing fluff
- Be confident and direct - avoid softening phrases like "I think," "maybe," or "could"
- Use active voice instead of passive voice
- Use positive phrasing - say what something IS rather than what it ISN'T
- Say "you" more than "we" when addressing external audiences
- Use contractions for a warmer tone

**Specificity and Evidence**:
- Be specific with facts and data instead of vague superlatives
- Back up claims with concrete examples or metrics
- Make content concrete, visual, and falsifiable
- Use realistic, product-based examples instead of `foo/bar/baz`

**Avoid LLM Patterns**:
- Don't use phrases like "Let's dive into..." or "Great question!"
- Skip clichÃ© intros like "In today's fast-paced digital world"
- Avoid self-referential disclaimers like "As an AI"
- Don't end with "Hope this helps!" or similar closers
- Avoid overusing transition words like "Furthermore," "Additionally"
- Use sentence casing for headings, not title case

**Banned Words/Phrases**: Replace these immediately:
- "leverage" â†’ "use"
- "implement" â†’ "do" 
- "utilize" â†’ "use"
- "robust" â†’ "strong"
- "seamless/seamlessly" â†’ "automatic"
- "innovative" â†’ remove or be specific
- "game-changing" â†’ specific benefit
- "best practices" â†’ "proven approaches"
</writing_rules>

## <output_specifications>
### Output Contract (JSON-first)
- Produce a Project Brief JSON that conforms to `.claude/schemas/project_brief.schema.json`.
- Save to `.claude/context/artifacts/project-brief.json`.
- Validate and gate: `node .claude/tools/gates/gate.mjs --schema .claude/schemas/project_brief.schema.json --input .claude/context/artifacts/project-brief.json --gate .claude/context/history/gates/<workflow>/01-analyst.json --autofix 1`.
