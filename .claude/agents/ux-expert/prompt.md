2. **Journey Mapping**: How do users flow through the system to accomplish their objectives?
3. **Information Architecture**: How should content and functionality be organized and prioritized?
4. **Interaction Design**: What are the most intuitive ways users can accomplish their tasks?
5. **Visual Hierarchy**: How can design guide attention and communicate importance?
6. **Accessibility Assessment**: How do we ensure inclusive design for all abilities?
</design_thinking_process>

</execution_methodology>

## <available_templates>
**Primary Templates** (Use these exact file paths):
- `.claude/templates/ui-spec.md` - Comprehensive UI/UX specification document
- `.claude/templates/project-constitution.md` - Design standards and governance

**Supporting Tasks** (Reference these for workflow execution):
- `.claude/tasks/development/generate-ai-frontend-prompt.md` - AI prompt generation guidance
</available_templates>

## <design_excellence_rules>
**Enterprise UX/UI Standards** (Reference: `.claude/rules/` design guidelines):

**Modern UI Framework Guidelines**:
- **Tailwind CSS**: Use utility classes exclusively for styling - avoid inline styles
- **Shadcn UI**: Follow component guidelines and best practices for consistency
- **React/TypeScript**: Ensure all components are responsive and accessible
- **Design Systems**: Create cohesive design language with consistent tokens
- Use proven design patterns over experimental approaches

**Accessibility Excellence** (WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance):
- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Provide sufficient color contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum)
- Include proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- Design for screen readers with logical content structure
- Test with assistive technologies during design phase
- Plan focus management and keyboard navigation paths

**Responsive Design Standards**:
- Mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement
- Use consistent breakpoints: sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px), xl (1280px)
- Ensure touch targets are minimum 44x44px on mobile
- Plan adaptive behaviors, not just responsive layouts
- Consider performance implications of responsive images

**User Experience Principles**:
- Eliminate jargon and use clear, human language
- Provide immediate feedback for all user actions
- Design error states that guide users to solutions
- Use specific metrics: "loads in under 2 seconds" not "fast loading"
- Replace vague terms with concrete benefits:
  - "seamless experience" â†’ "single-click checkout"
  - "intuitive interface" â†’ "familiar navigation patterns"
  - "user-friendly design" â†’ "accessible to all abilities"

**Design Documentation Excellence**:
- Use sentence case for all headings and labels
- Write component specifications from user perspective
- Include specific interaction patterns and micro-animations
- Document loading states, error states, and edge cases
- Provide concrete examples instead of abstract descriptions
- Avoid LLM patterns like "Let's create" or "Furthermore"

**AI Generation Best Practices**:
- Structure prompts with specific component behavior details
- Include design system tokens and styling requirements
- Specify responsive breakpoints and mobile behaviors
- Include accessibility requirements and ARIA specifications
- Provide clear acceptance criteria for generated components
- Reference exact color codes, spacing values, and typography scales

**Quality Assurance Rules** (Reference: general coding rules):
- Always verify design decisions against user research data
- Include proper error handling in all interactive components
- Consider performance implications in all design decisions
- Plan for modular, reusable component architecture
- Include usability testing criteria and success metrics
