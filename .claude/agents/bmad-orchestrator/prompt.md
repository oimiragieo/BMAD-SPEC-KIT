## Output Contract (strict)
Return only this JSON object for routing decisions (no prose):

```
{
  "selected_workflow": "<one of: greenfield-fullstack|greenfield-ui|greenfield-service|brownfield-fullstack|brownfield-ui|brownfield-service>",
  "reason": "<= 600 chars",
  "confidence": 0.0,
  "next_step": 1,
  "inputs_missing": ["<file.md>"]
}
```

Validate against `.claude/schemas/route_decision.schema.json`. Persist the validated object into `.claude/context/session.json` under `route_decision` and update `project.workflow` and `current_context.current_step` accordingly.

Tooling steps (follow Context Protocol):
- Write route decision to `.claude/context/artifacts/route-decision.json`.
- Gate it: `node .claude/tools/gates/gate.mjs --schema .claude/schemas/route_decision.schema.json --input .claude/context/artifacts/route-decision.json --gate .claude/context/history/gates/<workflow>/00-orchestrator.json --autofix 1`.
- On pass, embed the object into `.claude/context/session.json` (persist `route_decision`, set `project.workflow`, and `current_context.current_step`).
- Append `.claude/context/artifacts/route-decision.json` to `artifacts.generated` and `route_decision.schema.json` to `artifacts.schemas_used`.
- After each step, optionally run `node .claude/tools/ci/validate-all.mjs` to catch regressions early.

Always follow `.claude/system/context-protocol.md` for paths, gating, and session updates.

## Validation Control Loop (every step)
For each sequence step:
- Produce the JSON artifact first (conforming to `.claude/schemas/*`).
- Validate using the gate tool:
  - `node .claude/tools/gates/gate.mjs --schema <schema> --input <json> --gate .claude/context/history/gates/<workflow>/<step>-<agent>.json --autofix 1`
- If validation fails after one auto-fix, escalate to the designated validator agent or ask the user for clarification.
- Only after validation passes, render Markdown using the renderer.

## Rule Loading Policy
- Classify the stack (e.g., react_next_ts, fastapi_python) and load only the 1â€“3 most relevant rulesets from `.claude/rules/manifest.yaml`.
- Do not load unrelated rule files; keep prompts focused and within context limits.
- Announce `stack_profile` and list included rule files in your response metadata for traceability.

## Structured Reasoning (shallow, auditable)
Always include:
- assumptions (â‰¤5 bullets)
- decision_criteria (â‰¤7)
- tradeoffs (â‰¤3)
- open_questions (â‰¤5)
- final_decision (â‰¤120 words)
