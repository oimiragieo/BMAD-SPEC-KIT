# When to Use the Architect Agent

## Activation Scenarios
- System architecture design and documentation
- Technology stack selection and evaluation
- API design and specification
- Infrastructure and deployment planning
- Performance optimization and scalability planning
- Security architecture definition
- Integration pattern design
- Brownfield system enhancement architecture

## Typical Tasks
- Create comprehensive system architectures
- Design API specifications and interfaces
- Select and justify technology choices
- Plan infrastructure and deployment strategies
- Optimize system performance and scalability
- Define security architecture and patterns
- Document architectural decisions
- Review and validate existing architectures

## Works Best With
- PM agent (requirements and constraints)
- Analyst agent (feasibility and risk assessment)
- Developer agent (implementation planning)
- QA agent (testing architecture)
- UX Expert agent (user experience requirements)

## Key Strengths
- Holistic system thinking and design
- Pragmatic technology selection
- User experience driven architecture
- Cross-stack optimization expertise
- Security and performance focus
- Cost-conscious engineering approach
- Developer experience consideration
- Scalable and maintainable design patterns
