# Enhanced Workflow Engine - Context-Aware Execution

## System Overview

The Enhanced Workflow Engine provides intelligent workflow execution with context management, parallel processing, validation gates, and adaptive routing based on project complexity.

## Workflow Execution Engine

### Main Execution Controller
```yaml
execution_controller:
  initialization:
    - validate_workflow_definition
    - initialize_context_store
    - setup_agent_pool
    - configure_monitoring
    
  execution_loop:
    - determine_ready_steps
    - allocate_agent_resources
    - execute_parallel_groups
    - validate_outputs
    - update_context_store
    - check_quality_gates
    - plan_next_iteration
    
  completion_criteria:
    - all_steps_completed: true
    - quality_gates_passed: true  
    - context_validation: "success"
    - user_acceptance: "pending|approved"
```

## Integration with Existing Agent Prompts

### Context Injection Enhancement
Each existing agent prompt gets enhanced with:

```yaml
# Added to each agent prompt
## <enhanced_context_access>
### Structured Context Available:
{{#context_engine}}
**Previous Agent Outputs:**
{{#each completed_agents}}
- **{{name}}**: {{outputs.primary}} (Quality: {{quality_score}}/10)
  {{#each outputs.structured_data}}
  - {{key}}: {{value}}
  {{/each}}
{{/each}}

**Project Metadata:**
- Complexity Score: {{project_metadata.complexity_score}}/10
- Workflow Type: {{project_metadata.workflow_type}}
- Quality Threshold: {{configuration.quality_threshold}}

**Global Context:**
- Budget Level: {{global_context.project_constraints.budget_level}}
- Timeline: {{global_context.project_constraints.timeline}}
- Team Size: {{global_context.project_constraints.team_size}}
{{/context_engine}}
</enhanced_context_access>

## <quality_self_assessment>
After completing your work, provide this structured self-assessment:

**Quality Metrics:**
- Completeness Score (1-10): [Your assessment]
- Clarity Score (1-10): [Your assessment]
- Implementation Readiness (1-10): [Your assessment]
- Alignment with Previous Work (1-10): [Your assessment]

**Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] All required sections completed
- [ ] Addresses all input requirements
- [ ] Maintains consistency with previous agents
- [ ] Includes specific, actionable content
- [ ] No placeholder or vague language

**Context Validation:**
- [ ] Referenced all required previous outputs
- [ ] Maintained consistency with project constraints
- [ ] Aligned with complexity score and project type
</quality_self_assessment>
```

This Enhanced Workflow Engine transforms our static workflow system into an intelligent, adaptive orchestrator that manages context, validates quality, and recovers from errors automatically.
