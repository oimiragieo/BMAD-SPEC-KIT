# Cross-Agent Validation Protocol - Quality Assurance System

## System Overview

The Cross-Agent Validation Protocol ensures consistency, quality, and feasibility across all agent outputs through systematic peer review, conflict resolution, and consensus building mechanisms.

## Implementation Integration

### Enhanced Agent Validation Instructions
```yaml
# Added to each agent prompt
## <validation_responsibilities>
As part of the Cross-Agent Validation Protocol, you have specific responsibilities:

### When Validating Other Agents:
{{#each validation_targets}}
**Validating {{agent}} outputs:**
- **Focus Areas**: {{#each aspects}}{{this}}{{#unless @last}}, {{/unless}}{{/each}}
- **Validation Criteria**: {{validation_criteria}}
- **Quality Threshold**: {{quality_threshold}}/10
- **Conflict Resolution Role**: {{conflict_resolution_role}}

Your validation should assess:
1. **Accuracy**: Is the information correct and well-researched?
2. **Completeness**: Are all required elements present and sufficiently detailed?
3. **Consistency**: Does it align with your own analysis and outputs?
4. **Feasibility**: Is it realistic within project constraints?
5. **Quality**: Does it meet professional standards?

Provide structured feedback:
```yaml
validation_result:
  agent: "{{agent}}"
  output: "{{output_name}}"
  overall_score: X/10
  dimension_scores:
    completeness: X/10
    consistency: X/10  
    feasibility: X/10
    clarity: X/10
    actionability: X/10
  issues_identified:
    - category: "technical_feasibility"
      severity: "high|medium|low"
      description: "specific issue description"
      recommendation: "suggested improvement"
  approval_status: "approved|approved_with_conditions|requires_revision"
  conditions: ["list of required changes if approved with conditions"]
```
{{/each}}

### When Being Validated:
Your outputs will be validated by: {{#each validators}}{{agent}} ({{aspects}}){{#unless @last}}, {{/unless}}{{/each}}

**Response to Validation Feedback:**
1. **Review Thoroughly**: Consider all feedback objectively
2. **Address Issues**: Revise your work to address valid concerns
3. **Clarify Misunderstandings**: Explain your rationale where validators may have misunderstood
4. **Escalate Conflicts**: If you disagree with feedback, initiate consensus building process
5. **Document Changes**: Clearly indicate what you revised and why
</validation_responsibilities>

## <consensus_building>
When conflicts arise in validation:

1. **State Your Position Clearly**: Explain your reasoning with evidence
2. **Listen to Other Perspectives**: Understand other agents' concerns
3. **Seek Common Ground**: Look for areas of agreement to build from
4. **Propose Compromises**: Suggest hybrid approaches when possible
5. **Focus on User Value**: Remember the end goal is user and business success
6. **Document Agreements**: Record final decisions and rationale

If consensus cannot be reached, follow the authority chain for your domain area.
</consensus_building>
```

This Cross-Agent Validation Protocol creates a robust quality assurance system that ensures all agents work together cohesively while maintaining their individual expertise areas.
