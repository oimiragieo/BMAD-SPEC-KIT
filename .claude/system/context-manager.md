# Advanced Context Management System

## Current Problems
1. **No persistent context between agent handoffs**
2. **No structured data passing mechanism** 
3. **No context validation or error recovery**
4. **No context versioning or rollback capability**

## Proposed Context Management Architecture

### Context Store Structure
```json
{
  "session_id": "uuid-here",
  "project_name": "task-management-app",
  "workflow_type": "greenfield-fullstack",
  "current_step": 3,
  "context_version": "1.0.2",
  "agents": {
    "analyst": {
      "status": "completed",
      "outputs": {
        "project_brief": {
          "file_path": "artifacts/project-brief.md",
          "structured_data": {
            "target_users": ["team_leads", "team_members"],
            "core_features": ["task_creation", "assignment", "tracking"],
            "complexity_score": 7,
            "technical_requirements": ["real_time", "collaboration"]
          },
          "execution_time": "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z",
          "quality_score": 8.5
        }
      }
    },
    "pm": {
      "status": "in_progress",
      "inputs": {
        "project_brief": "@agents.analyst.outputs.project_brief",
        "derived_context": {
          "user_personas": "extracted from project_brief.target_users",
          "feature_priorities": "derived from complexity_score"
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "global_context": {
    "project_constraints": {
      "budget": "startup",
      "timeline": "3_months", 
      "team_size": "2_developers"
    },
    "technical_stack": {
      "preferences": ["React", "Node.js", "PostgreSQL"],
      "constraints": ["no_microservices", "single_deployment"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Context Passing Mechanisms
```yaml
# Enhanced workflow with context management
- step: 2
  name: "Requirements Documentation"
  agent: pm
  context_inputs:
    - source: "agents.analyst.outputs.project_brief"
      extract: ["target_users", "core_features", "constraints"]
    - source: "global_context.technical_stack"
      as: "tech_preferences"
  context_validation:
    required: ["target_users", "core_features"]
    optional: ["constraints", "tech_preferences"]
  context_transformation:
    - transform: "target_users"
      to: "user_personas"
      method: "expand_with_demographics"
```
