# Course Correction Task

## Purpose

Execute strategic course correction when projects deviate from planned outcomes, requirements change, or new constraints emerge. Provide systematic analysis and actionable recommendations to realign project trajectory with business objectives.

## When to Use Course Correction

### Trigger Scenarios

**Requirement Changes**:
- Significant business requirement modifications
- New stakeholder priorities or constraints
- Market conditions affecting project scope
- Technology or resource limitations discovered

**Quality Issues**:
- Multiple quality gate failures
- Technical debt accumulation
- Performance or security concerns
- User feedback indicating major misalignment

**Timeline/Budget Pressures**:
- Schedule delays requiring scope adjustment
- Budget constraints necessitating priority changes
- Resource availability changes
- External deadline pressures

**Technical Challenges**:
- Architecture decisions proving problematic
- Integration complexity exceeding estimates
- Scalability issues requiring redesign
- Technology stack limitations discovered

## Course Correction Framework

### 1. Situation Analysis

**Current State Assessment**:

- Assess user impact of reduced functionality
- Plan future phases for deferred features

**Option 2: Timeline Extension**  
- Realistic schedule adjustment based on current progress
- Resource reallocation to critical path items
- Stakeholder communication and expectation management
- Risk mitigation for extended timeline

**Option 3: Resource Increase**

- Staged rollout with incremental value delivery
- User feedback integration opportunities
- Risk reduction through smaller releases

### 3. Decision Framework

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- **Business Value**: Preserved value vs. original objectives
- **Technical Risk**: Implementation complexity and success probability
- **Timeline Impact**: Schedule adherence and delivery predictability  
- **Resource Efficiency**: Cost-effectiveness and resource utilization
