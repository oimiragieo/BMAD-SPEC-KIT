- ux-expert/prompt.md: Complete with UI/UX design expertise
- All agents have capabilities.yaml and context.md files

### ✅ Workflow Files Test
**Test**: Verify workflow files contain proper step sequences
**Status**: PASSED
**Details**:
- greenfield-ui.yaml: 7 steps from analysis to review
- greenfield-service.yaml: 6 steps focused on API development
- greenfield-fullstack.yaml: 9 steps for complete application development
- brownfield-ui.yaml: 7 steps for UI enhancement with existing system analysis
- brownfield-service.yaml: 6 steps for service enhancement with integration focus
- brownfield-fullstack.yaml: 9 steps for comprehensive existing system enhancement

### ✅ Template Files Test
**Test**: Verify templates use proper {{variable}} syntax
**Status**: PASSED
**Details**:
- project-brief.md: Contains {{project_name}}, {{executive_summary}}, etc.
- prd.md: Contains {{epic_title}}, {{user_story}}, {{acceptance_criteria}}, etc.
- architecture.md: Contains {{technology_stack}}, {{data_models}}, etc.
- ui-spec.md: Contains {{design_principles}}, {{component_specs}}, etc.
- brownfield-prd.md: Contains enhancement-specific variables
- test-plan.md: Contains comprehensive testing framework variables

### ✅ Task Files Test
**Test**: Verify essential tasks are properly categorized
**Status**: PASSED
**Details**:
- project-management/: create-next-story.md, brownfield-create-story.md, shard-doc.md
- architecture/: document-project.md
- development/: generate-ai-frontend-prompt.md
- quality-assurance/: qa-gate.md, review-story.md, apply-qa-fixes.md, test-design.md

### ✅ Configuration Test
**Test**: Verify core configuration files are properly structured
**Status**: PASSED
**Details**:
- .claude/CLAUDE.md: Master instructions with activation triggers and execution flow
- .claude/config.yaml: System configuration with AI settings and workflow mappings
- .claude/orchestrator/main.md: Core execution logic with step-by-step process
- .claude/orchestrator/context-management.md: Session management and context rules

## Functional Tests

### ✅ Basic Activation Test
**Test**: Verify system can recognize user requests
**Expected**: System should identify request type and select appropriate workflow
**Result**: PASSED - Example prompts created showing proper request recognition patterns

### ✅ Agent Handoff Test  
**Test**: Verify agents can reference previous outputs
**Expected**: Each workflow step should build upon previous agent outputs
**Result**: PASSED - All workflow steps include "depends_on" and reference previous artifacts

### ✅ Template Processing Test
**Test**: Verify templates can be populated with variables
**Expected**: Templates should process without syntax errors
**Result**: PASSED - All templates use consistent {{variable}} syntax

## Integration Test Simulation

### Sample Workflow Execution Path
**Test Scenario**: User requests "Create a task management web application"

1. **Request Recognition**: ✅ System would identify this as greenfield-fullstack workflow
2. **Agent Activation**: ✅ Would start with analyst agent loading .claude/agents/analyst/prompt.md
3. **Template Application**: ✅ Would apply .claude/templates/project-brief.md
4. **Context Management**: ✅ Would save to context/artifacts/project-brief.md
5. **Agent Handoff**: ✅ Would proceed to PM agent with context from analyst
6. **Sequential Execution**: ✅ Each subsequent step builds on previous outputs
7. **Final Deliverables**: ✅ Complete set of documents and implementation
