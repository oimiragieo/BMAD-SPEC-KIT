# Implementation plan template

Use before coding to align structure, tasks, and testing.

## scope
- features/stories in scope with acceptance criteria refs
- out of scope and assumptions

## architecture trace
- links to PRD, UX spec, architecture sections
- key decisions affecting implementation

## code structure
- directories, modules, naming conventions
- interfaces/types and shared utilities

## dependencies
- packages (name@version) and rationale
- security considerations and license notes

## environment & config
- env vars, secrets, and defaults
- local dev setup and run commands

## tasks & estimates
- task list with estimates and dependencies
- risks and mitigations per task

## testing plan
- unit, integration, e2e: what, where, how measured
- coverage targets and tooling

## rollout
- migration scripts, toggles, and monitoring
- fallback/rollback procedures

## sign-off checklist
- lint/tests green, docs updated, artifacts gated
