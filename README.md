```

### JSON‑First Artifacts & Gates (New)
- Artifacts are produced as JSON first and validated against schemas in `.claude/schemas/`.
- Render human‑readable Markdown using the built‑in renderer:
  - `node .claude/tools/renderers/bmad-render.mjs prd .claude/context/artifacts/prd.json > .claude/context/artifacts/prd.md`
- Enforce deterministic quality gates with a validate → auto‑fix → escalate loop:
  - `node .claude/tools/gates/gate.mjs --schema .claude/schemas/product_requirements.schema.json --input .claude/context/artifacts/prd.json --gate .claude/context/history/gates/greenfield-fullstack/02-pm.json --autofix 1`

### CI Validation
- GitHub Action `Validate Artifacts` runs on PRs and `main` to validate all `.claude/context/artifacts/*.json` against schemas.
- See `.github/workflows/validate-artifacts.yml` and `.claude/tools/ci/validate-all.mjs`.

## 🏗️ Enterprise Systems Deep Dive

### 1. Context Engine - Structured Data Flow
- **Structured Context Store**: JSON-based data passing between agents
- **Validation Rules**: Automatic validation of context integrity
- **Cross-References**: Agents reference specific previous outputs  
- **Version Control**: Context checkpointing for recovery
- **Performance**: Optimized context loading and caching

### 2. Enhanced Workflow Engine - Intelligent Execution
- **Dependency Analysis**: Automatic detection of parallel execution opportunities
- **Quality Gates**: Automated validation at each workflow step
- **Adaptive Routing**: Dynamic workflow modification based on complexity
- **Resource Management**: Intelligent allocation of computational resources
- **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time execution tracking and optimization

### Deterministic Orchestration & Routing (New)
- **Low‑temp routing**: Orchestrator and routing temperatures set to 0.2 for repeatable decisions.
- **Route decision schema**: Orchestrator emits a JSON decision validated by `.claude/schemas/route_decision.schema.json` and persists it to `.claude/context/session.json`.
- **Selective rules loading**: Loads only 1–3 stack‑relevant rules from `.claude/rules/manifest.yaml` to maximize focus.
- **Per‑agent temperature policy**: Creative agents (UX/Developer) run at moderate temps (≈0.5–0.6); analysis/QA lower (≈0.3–0.4).

### 3. Intelligent Templates - Adaptive Generation
- **Conditional Logic**: Templates adapt based on project complexity
- **Validation Rules**: Automatic quality checking of generated content
- **Variable Substitution**: Advanced placeholder replacement with validation
- **Quality Assessment**: Built-in scoring and improvement suggestions
- **Context Awareness**: Templates use structured data from previous agents

### 4. Validation Protocol - Quality Assurance
- **Cross-Agent Validation**: Agents validate each other's work automatically
- **Conflict Resolution**: Automated consensus building for disagreements
- **Quality Metrics**: 5-dimensional scoring (completeness, consistency, feasibility, clarity, actionability)
- **Escalation Procedures**: Clear authority chains for unresolved conflicts
- **Decision Documentation**: Complete audit trail of all quality decisions

### Executable Workflows (New)
- Each step declares explicit `inputs`, JSON‑first `creates`, `validators` (schema/checklist), `on_fail`, and a `render` block.
- Gates enforce a small, repeatable loop per step: validate(schema) → auto‑fix (1 try) → escalate → render.

### 5. Parallel Execution Engine - Performance Optimization
- **Dependency Graph Analysis**: Identifies parallelization opportunities
- **Resource Management**: Intelligent CPU and memory allocation
- **Synchronization**: Smart barrier coordination for parallel agents
- **Load Balancing**: Dynamic resource allocation based on agent needs
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time execution metrics and optimization

### 6. Error Recovery System - Enterprise Reliability
- **Multi-Layer Detection**: Syntax, content, consistency, and system error detection
- **Automatic Recovery**: Retry with intelligence, fallback strategies
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues functioning with reduced capabilities
- **Learning System**: Continuous improvement from error patterns
- **Checkpoint Recovery**: Rollback to previous working states

### 7. Adaptive Workflow System - Intelligent Routing
- **Complexity Scoring**: Multi-dimensional analysis of project characteristics
- **Dynamic Branching**: Workflow paths adapt based on project needs
- **Domain Specialization**: Healthcare, finance, e-commerce variants
- **Performance Learning**: System optimizes workflow selection over time
- **User Feedback Integration**: Incorporates user preferences and constraints

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

### Execution Performance
- Benchmarks vary by environment; use the gate + schema validation to measure your own pass rates and timings locally.

### Quality Improvements
- JSON‑first artifacts and gate checks improve output consistency and validation coverage across workflows.

### Reliability Practices
- Validate → auto‑fix → escalate gates at each step; route decisions logged to session context for traceability.

## 🧠 Claude Thinking Optimization System

### Intelligent Thinking Budget Allocation
The system uses Claude-specific thinking triggers to optimize decision quality:

| Thinking Level | Usage | Applied To | Performance Impact |
|---------------|-------|------------|-------------------|
| **`ultrathink`** | Critical decisions requiring maximum analysis | System architecture, security design | 3-5x more thorough |
| **`think harder`** | Complex trade-offs and risk assessments | Feature prioritization, QA analysis | 2-4x better analysis |
| **`think hard`** | Important analysis tasks | Market research, UX optimization | 2-3x more comprehensive |
| **`think`** | Standard reasoning and validation | Basic analysis, simple validation | Optimized baseline |

### Example Thinking Allocation
```markdown
🏗️ Architect Agent:
- **ultrathink** optimal technology stack selection
- **think harder** database schema design implications  
- **think hard** API architecture patterns
- **think** implementation guidance validation

📋 PM Agent:
- **think harder** feature prioritization with resource constraints
- **think hard** requirements traceability mapping
- **think** user story validation
```

## 🛡️ Enterprise Security & Safety Standards

### Security-First Development Philosophy
- **❌ NEVER use `--dangerously-skip-permissions`** for enterprise workflows
- **✅ Smart Enterprise Mode**: Batch operations while preserving security gates
- **✅ Audit Trail Maintenance**: Complete logging of all critical decisions
- **✅ Quality Gate Preservation**: Maintain validation for all production code

### Enterprise-Safe Workflow Acceleration
Instead of dangerous bypasses, the system uses intelligent optimization:
- **Batch Similar Operations**: Reduce permission overhead without compromising security
- **Progressive Permissions**: Escalate only for critical decisions requiring validation
- **Pre-validation**: Validate resources before agent execution begins
- **Smart Confirmations**: Group non-critical approvals while preserving security gates
